WATTBOX RESTful API Module
--------------------------

This node.js module was an experiment at exporting modules to be included in larger applications.

The Wattbox is a power-management solution produced by SnapAV. Older versions of their products support a RESTful API, and this module has been developed against v2.0 of their API. (Upstream documentation PDF provided in the docs folder)

Included in the examples folder is a flows file for Node-Red that implements this integration and populates a Node-Red Dashboard with basic command-and-control functions.
